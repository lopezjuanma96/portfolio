# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### On pages

I'll use the pages type to develop the main webpage and extra pages needed for the website.

### On blog

I'll use the blog type to write about my projects and other things I'm working on.

### On docs

I'll use the docs type to write courses and tutorials about stuff I know and want to share with the world.
