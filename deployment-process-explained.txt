///////////////
VERSION CONTROL
///////////////
push all commits to dev branch
main branch has separate history so pulling and pushing from source won't work (in fact you could delete the main branch from local)

////////////
LOCAL DEPLOY
////////////

with 'npm run start' the website is "built" interactively and served locally
this makes some features work differently from the final deploy, for example LOCALEs can only be tested separately
to test locally efectively then, run:

```
npm run build
```

which will build the website files on the './build' folder, and then run:

```
npm run serve
```

to deploy the website from the './build' folder, which will act exactly as the remote deployments.

REMOTE DEPLOY

Finally, to push to main and update the website, run this command:

```
cmd /C "set "GIT_USER=lopezjuanma96" && npm run deploy"
```
