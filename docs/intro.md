# Introduction to my Courses

On this `Courses` pages I'm trying to present the world with everything I know and how I got to know it.

## Methodology

This wil be explanatory text, focused mainly on practice and only touch theory necessary for the practice (and maybe some interesting points too :D).

## Courses

This is the list of courses I'm currently working on:

- [ ] [Python In 100 Steps](/docs/category/python)
- [ ] [Data Science In 100 Steps](/docs/category/data-science)
