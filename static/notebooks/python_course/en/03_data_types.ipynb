Each programming language will have different data types. We will focus on the most common ones used in Python. We will also divide them into *simple* and *compound* data types. This is not necessarily an official classification, but I feel it will help us understand them better.\n",

The more complex an object like this is, the more time it will take us to understand how it works, but likely it will provide us more tools too!"

    "## Conversion: using the data types keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the data types, we can start converting between them. There are plenty of situations where this will be useful. For example, our user might give us a number as a string and we want to transform it into an integer or float to use it on a math operation. Or the other way around, we might get the result of a math operation and want to concatenate it at the end of a message string to print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know that not every conversion is possible. For example, we can not convert a string that says \"Hello World\" into an integer, since it is not a number. In the cases were we can't, Python will throw us an error with the description. We'll stay out of there for know, but be sure we will see them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to convert data types is to use the data type keywords as functions. If you take a quick look at the list above, I introduced every data type with their corresponding keyword first: `int` for Integers, `str` for Strings, `dict` for dictionaries and so on. Well, those keywords are also functions that will convert the value we pass as an argument (inside the parenthesis) to the data type they represent:"
