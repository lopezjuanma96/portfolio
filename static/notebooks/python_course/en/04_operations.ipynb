    "**Basic Arithmetic Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic arithmetic operations are the ones you already know from school. Addition, substraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation. These are performed with the symbols `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `**` respectively (we had already seen all of them except for the last one). The root has no symbol, but we can use inverse property to apply it through the exponentiation operation. If you don't rememeber it, we can calculate a root by moving its index to the denominator of the exponent - if there is no exponent, it is assumed to be 1. Then the square (2) root of `n` can be calculated as `n**(1/2)`. And there is not that much more to say about these, it is plain old math.\n",

    "**Integer division**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a variant of the division operation, which returns the result as an integer. This means the decimal part of the result is discarded, and its data type is set to `int`. Remember the normal division **ALWAYS** returned a float even when the result was whole. The integer division is performed with the symbol `//`. Another name for this operation is **floor division**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modulus**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulus operation returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. The modulus operation is performed with the symbol `%`. Oh.. You don't remember what the reminder is? Well consider the Integer division we talked about before. The reminder is the number that is left after this type of division is performed. For example:\n",
    "- The common division (`/`) of 5 by 2 is 2.5.\n",
    "- The integer division (`//`) of 5 by 2 is 2.\n",
    "- The modulus (`%`) of 5 by 2 is 1.\n",
    "One important thing to mention is that if the modulus of two numbers is 0, then the first number is a multiple of the second one. This is useful, for example, to check if a number is even or odd. If the modulus of a number by 2 is 0, then the number is even, otherwise it is odd."

    "On the previous chapter, when dealing with the boolean data type, we saw that the numeric operations can be applied to booleans because Python considers `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. Those are not the operations we want to talk about. We want to talk about logical operations. At some point in your life you might have been taught about `logic`, in some math course or something. I didn't, I learned about logic when learning programming, and I ended up fine, right? But if you did, this are the operations you might have seen there.\n",

If you said `I will go to the club (this is the result) if I have money AND I'm not having fun on the course`.\n",

    "**Logical NOT**\n",
    "The logical NOT operation is performed with the `not` keyword. Unlike previous operations, it is applied to only one operand, flipping its value.
