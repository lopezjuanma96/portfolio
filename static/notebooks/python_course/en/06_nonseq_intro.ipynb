    "Up to now, we've been working with sequential code. This means our code run a line with a task, after it finishes it runs the next line with the next task, and so on until there's no more code to run. This is the default behaviour of Python code - and most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "But think, for example, of any of your favourite game or phone app. You will notice that there are some tasks that are run sequentially, and others that aren't. In fact, instead of thinking of a digital example, let's take a look at a more real one:\n",

    "Let's say you are leaving your house for a week, and a friend of yours is willing to take care of it while you are gone. You want to make sure that your friend knows what to do, so you write a list of instructions for them. There are parts of that list that are shaped like a sequence, like \"do this task, and then this\", but you will likely need to break the sequence, like \"if this happens, do this, otherwise do that\", or \"do this task, then this, then reapeat this 5 times\". If this is not clear enough, maybe this diagram will help:\n",

    "As you can see, on the left side, at each step there is a single task to run, and then move on to the next one. On the right side, there is sometimes one task, but also maybe a decision point (romboid) to choose between two or more tasks, or maybe a loop (circle) where to repeat a task a number of times. This diagram style is called a flowchart, and it's a very useful tool to plan your code before you start writing it, but we will see this in depth in a later lesson, once we have more tools to create more complex code."

    "\n",
    "To be able to break the sequence, and control the flow of this *non-sequential* code, we need a way to tell Python what to do. In the same way we learned the basic syntax of Python on the first chapters, there is a syntax to control the flow of the code. For this syntax we will use specific keywords, like we've been doing for types, printings, and so. These keywords are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **if**, **elif** & **else**: Togheter with booleans they will help us make decisions. These is also code *conditionals* on coding, and will help us evaluate a situation and based on the result take one path or another.\n",
    "- **for** & **in**: These are one set of keywords that will help us run loops. Loops are repetitions of the same code a certain number of times. In the case of the for loop, this loop will run over a chain of ordered elements, like a tuple, list or keys/values of a dictionary.\n",
    "- **while**: This is the other set of keywords (actually one keyword) that will help us run loops. In this case, the loop will run while a condition is met, as if there where a conditional checked every time the loop ends that tells Python if it should run the loop again or not.\n",
    "- **break**, **continue** & **pass**: These are used togheter with any of the loop keywords to give you more control inside the loop. They are not mandatory, but they can be very useful in some cases, for example to stop a loop not after a certain number of repetitions, but in the middle of running one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with other keywords, these ones are reserved words, so you can't use them as variable names. Also, they are case sensitive, so you need to write them exactly as they are written here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next chapters will be dedicated to see how to use these keywords, and how to combine them to **break the sequence!** (let me just say it a few more times). I only listed them so you start to get familiar with them and to show you how the syntax for them works."
