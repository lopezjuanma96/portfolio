    "The boolean operations we saw on the *operations* chapter are also aplicable to boolean expressions. This means we can combine boolean expressions with the `and`, `or` and `not` operators. This is useful to check multiple conditions at the same time, or to negate a condition. Remember, as a refresher, that this operators handle boolean values and return boolean values, based on the truth tables:\n",

    "**Let's go directly to an example:** We will define a variable `user_enterred_number` to represent the user input. This input will only be valid if it is a number between 1 and 10. Also if another variable called `accept_zero` is `True`, we will accept 0 as an input. There are plenty of way to achieve this, here is one."
