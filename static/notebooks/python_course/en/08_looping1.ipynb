Actually, let me also recommend a girl from my lovely country Argentina, Silvina Moreno, she is not a loop pedal specific but she has a lot of videos using loop pedal.\n",

I just remembered a Hot Wheels PC game where you could build your own digital tracks and then go through them with your car. I used to play that game a lot when I was a kid.\n",

This way they repeat the code for a certain number of times.
